## 2. Math

You do need atleast a highschool level of understanding as becuase machine learning mainly revolves around matrices, vectors and calculus.

### 3. Python libraries

Almost all of machine learning revolves around these libraries, so it is important to get a good understanding of these libraries.
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
You can find tutorials on these libraries on youtube or any other platform.
